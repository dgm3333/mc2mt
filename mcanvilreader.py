##NB! Future blocks will require the Add tag to be checked and mixed in!
#Each section also has a "Add" tag, which is a DataLayer byte array just like 
#"Data". The "Add" tag is not included in the converter since the old format 
#never had block ids above 255. This extra tag is created whenever a block 
#requires it, so the getTile() method needs to check if the array exists and 
#then combine it with the default block data. In other words, 
#blockId = (add << 8) + baseId.

        # Blocks, Data, Skylight, ... heightmap
        #Blocks contain the block ids; Data contains the extra info: 4 bits of lighting info + 4 bits of 'extra fields'
        # eg Lamp direction, crop wetness, etc.
        # Heightmap gives us quick access to the top surface of everything - ie optimise out iterating through all sky blocks.
        
        #To access a specific block from either the block or data array from XYZ coordinates, use the following formula:
        # Index = x + (y * Height + z) * Width 

        ##Note that the old format is XZY ((x * 16 + z) * 16 + y) and the new format is YZX ((y * 16 + z) * 16 + x)

        #16x16 (256) ints of heightmap data. Each int records the lowest level
        #in each column where the light from the sky is at full strength. Speeds up
        #computing of the SkyLight. Note: This array's indexes are ordered Z,X 
        #whereas the other array indexes are ordered X,Z,Y.

        #loadedData -> we buffer everything into lists, then batch-create the
        #vertices later. This makes the model build in Blender many, many times faster

        #list of named, distinct material meshes. add vertices to each, only in batches.
        #Optimisation: 'Hollow volumes': only add if there is at least 1 orthogonal non-same-type neighbour.
        #Aggressive optimisation: only load if there is 1 air orthogonal neighbour (or transparent materials).
